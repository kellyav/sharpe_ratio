# Sharpe Ratio Theory Explained


The Sharpe ratio is an important equation that helps users understand the expected return of a portfolio based on the level of risk taken.


**Sharpe Ratio is written as follows: (Rp – Rf) / Op**

- *Rp* stands for the return of the portfolio

- *Rf* stands for the risk free rate 

- *Op* stands for the standard deviation of the portfolio - used for symbolizing portfolio risk



## What does the Sharpe Ratio tell us? 

We want as high of a Sharpe Ratio as possible. 
This is because the higher the Sharpe Ratio, the better a portfolio returns per taken risk. 
Portfolio return is the ultimate goal, since it represents the overall loss or gain an investment portfolio has achieved during a period of time.


## Standard Deviation as Risk

The standard deviation is a measure of the amount of variation or dispersion of a set of values. 

- A low standard deviation shows that the values tend to be close to the mean of the set 
- A high standard deviation means that the values are spread out over a wider range

In the above Sharpe Ratio formula, we see that Standard Deviation and the ratio of return from a portfolio is inversely related. 


### The SD Formula

$\sigma = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N | x_{i} - \mu | ^{2})}$

- x is a value in the data set
- μ is the mean of the data set, and 
- N is the number of data points in the population.

Note here that this section of the formula: **| x_i - μ |^2** is 
the absolute value of the distance from each data point (x_i) to the mean (μ), squared 


The standard deviation measured in this problem set represents the variability of a stock return distribution over the mean. High variation in stock is seen as risky, and vice versa.
