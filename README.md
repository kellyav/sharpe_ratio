# Risk and Returns: The Sharpe Ratio
Use the Python tool pandas to calculate and compare profitability and risk of different investments using the Sharpe Ratio.

## The Sharpe Ratio
When you assess whether to invest in an asset, you want to look not only at how much money you could make but also at how much risk you are taking. The Sharpe Ratio, developed by Nobel Prize winner William Sharpe some 50 years ago, does precisely this: it compares the return of an investment to that of an alternative and relates the relative return to the risk of the investment, measured by the standard deviation of returns.

## Details
In this project, I apply the Sharpe ratio to real financial data using pandas.
